# Server-APIs-Weather-Dashboard

This app allows users to see the weather forecast for cities of their choosing. It uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/) to retrieve weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

## Installation

To run this app, you will need an API key from OpenWeatherMap. You can register for a free account [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) and get your API key. Once you have your key, you will need to replace the value of the `apiKey` variable in the `script.js` file with your own key.

You will also need a web browser that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can open the `index.html` file in your browser to launch the app.

## Usage

The app has a simple and intuitive design. You can enter a city name in the search box and click the search button to see the current and future weather conditions for that city. The app will also save your search history in the local storage and display it below the search box. You can click on any city in the history to see its weather again.

The app will show you the following information for each city:

- City name
- Date
- Weather icon
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed

The app will also show you a 5-day forecast for the city, with the same information as above, except for the wind speed.

You can use this app to plan your trips according to the weather outlook for multiple cities.
